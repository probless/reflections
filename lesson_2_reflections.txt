What happens when ypu initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it??
What happens when ypu initialize a new repository is that a directory essentially becomes a repository so that you can apply version-control. We need to do it because we cannot be having all of our files as repositories

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different than the working directory and the reopsitory in that it is an intermediate step between the two. It allows us to select the files that we want t o commit to changes.
